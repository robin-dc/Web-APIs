## 📍 Why Learn Web APIs?
Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software systems to communicate and interact with each other over the internet. They serve as bridges between applications, enabling data exchange and functionality integration. By understanding web APIs, developers can leverage existing services and functionalities offered by various platforms, such as social media, payment gateways, mapping services, and more. This allows for faster development, reduced code complexity, and enhanced application capabilities. Additionally, with the increasing popularity of mobile and web applications, knowing how to consume and integrate APIs enables developers to create robust, interconnected, and feature-rich applications that can leverage the power of external services and data sources.
